# Repo for Dave Berner homepage

This is a really simple site for my homepage which can be viewed at [https://www.davidberner.co.uk](https://www.davidberner.co.uk).

It seemed overkill to use a complex SCSS structure or build tools for this project so I've opted to keep styles in one file, have a basic reset and compile on the command line.

To complile SCSS:

`cd path/to/repo` `scss --watch scss:assets/css`
